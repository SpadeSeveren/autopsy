        "observational_text": "Clumps of wiry black hair cling to the side of the victim’s head. Several loose curls have been caked with blood, effectively gluing them down. It’s difficult to tell if the victim’s hair is greasy and unkempt, or grown dirty since the murder.  The victim’s face looks peaceful, as if he’s sleeping and will wake up at any moment. Despite the injuries on the rest of his body, his face remains relatively undamaged.  His facial features are soft. A rounded chin and flat cheeks that haven’t quite lost all their baby fat. Some dirt is smudged on the left side of his face, just below the cheekbone.  Although his body has since picked up some dirt and grime, his complexion remains relatively clear. The color has drained from his face, highlighting just how smooth his skin is. Whatever poor choices led to his death clearly didn’t involve a flawed skincare routine.  The head injury is a brutal one. Although it’s relatively fresh, bits of blood have begun to coagulate in his hair and pool around the injury. The bleeding and hair make it difficult to determine the exact dimensions of the wound, but it seems to extend from behind his ear up towards his scalp.  Whatever impact injured his head was delivered with enough force to partially crack his skull, giving his overall head shape an uneven and somewhat flat appearance. Clumps of loose skin around the point of contact suggest the possibility of a serrated weapon, but it will ultimately be impossible to determine the exact dimensions without shaving his head and compromising potential trace evidence. Several smaller tears are present along the back of the scalp. These partially scabbed injuries, along with missing strands of hair suggest that bits of his hair were forcefully torn out prior to death.",

Webs of burst capillaries indicate that the trauma was severe, but the blooming makes it difficult to tell the initial dimensions of the impact. The victim’s fingernails are jagged and uneven, suggesting that he frequently bit his nails. Trace organic matter seems to be stuck under the fingernails and caked with dried blood. It is unclear if the blood belongs to the victim or another party. One of the victim’s fingernails--his left ring finger--has been torn clean off. The skin underneath is raw and agitated. The thumb on his left hand is badly injured, and appears to be bent out of shape. It protrudes at an odd angle, having been broken just above the middle joint. Discoloration is especially pronounced. The victim’s left arm is noticeably more discolored than the other. The uncertain TOD widens the potential range of factors that could cause this.

His left knee shows faded incision marks, the injury lost to time like so many of my past loves. A possible sign of reconstructive surgery, human hands knitting together what cellular division could not. Sometimes I wonder what my life would have been like, had these hands been turned towards restructuring the living instead of examining the dead. The most notable feature on the victim’s legs is a tattoo that occupies most of their calf. While the tattoo looks lightly faded, the hair around it has been shaved and a few points are scabbing over, suggesting it has recently been touched up. The tattoo design is not familiar to any investigating police officers, but the recent additions may help us identify the tattoo artist and--by extension--the victim. This tattoo in question is a slightly faded custom design done in single-color common shading ink. The design appears consistently faded which suggests it healed improperly the first time but such information is likely irrelevant to the investigation. Although the source is unknown, the stylistic designs on the tattoo are reminiscent of a band logo. A large gothic ‘K’ sits in the middle of a celtic web in the center of two flourishing wings. Several rings of runic lettering encircle the logo although these appear to be pure direction instead of any translated meaning. While the wings have a similar structure to common depictions of angel wings, they are illustrated using dozens of angular curved lines instead of illustrated feathers. The wingtips feature rather distinctive tapering, suggesting that they’re supposed to look like blade edges. The ‘K’ logo itself is written in a faux-middle ages gothic lettering. To be more specific, it appears to have come from a common font based around Bavarian-Germanic title characters. The entire tattoo appears to have all been done at once, suggesting that this is a single cohesive design with no modifications besides the recent line touch ups.",
